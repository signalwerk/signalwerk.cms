This dual-directional approach not only accommodates linguistic nuances but also offers a dynamic typographic landscape. Historically, vertical writing (tategaki) was the norm, running from top to bottom and right to left. However, influenced by Western styles, horizontal writing (yokogaki) – running from left to right and top to bottom – has become wide spread in modern Japan, particularly in digital media.[^wiki-japanese-writing-system]  \nThe choice of direction can also be used to separate or accentuate[^gpt-setting-aesthetic-accents] specific elements within a text. This interplay between vertical and horizontal orientations adds a layer of visual interest and meaning, making the text not just a carrier of information but also an element of design.\n\n\n\n[^wiki-japanese-writing-system]: [Wikipedia · Japanese writing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_writing_system)\n[^gpt-setting-aesthetic-accents]: [ChatGPT · finding a title for the chapter «Setting aesthetic accents»](https://chat.openai.com/share/5f01e089-efbc-439e-bcfe-f1bfb978b2bc)"

However, unlike Western typography, where cursive fonts are often used for emphasis or style, Japanese script does not have a direct cursive equivalent. As a result, alternative methods are necessary for typographic characterization. Font weights are commonly used, and there are many different typefaces available. Similarly, colour is not only used for visual appeal, but also to establish hierarchy and guide the reader's attention."
