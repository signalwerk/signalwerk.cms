## Welcome to the Frontmatter Example

This markdown file demonstrates how frontmatter values are used to configure page attributes.

### Frontmatter Features

The frontmatter at the top of this file sets:

- **title**: "Custom Title from Frontmatter" (instead of deriving from filename)
- **lang**: "de" (German)
- **path**: "/test/" (custom URL path)
- **class**: "special-page" (custom CSS class)
- **date**: Custom date value

### Content Section

This is the main content that will be rendered as markdown.

You can use all standard markdown features:

- Lists
- **Bold text**
- _Italic text_
- Links and more

### Code Example

```javascript
console.log("Frontmatter is awesome!");
```

The content below the frontmatter block is processed as normal markdown.
